>>>VARIABLES: Naming and Using Variables

	•Variable names can contain only letters(a-z), numbers(0-9), and underscores(_)
	•They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number;viz: message_1 but not 1_message.
	•Spaces( ) are not allowed in variable names, but underscores(_) can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works, but greeting message will cause errors.
	•Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular pro-
grammatic purpose, such as the word print . (See “Python Keywordsand Built-in Functions” on page 489.)
	•Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better
than length_of_persons_name.
	.Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.

Note:
	The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but it’s a good idea to avoid using them for now.
@Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables:
					Every programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day. Although good programmers might create errors, they also know how to respond to those errors efficiently.

>>>STRINGS: 
	A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this:
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
	This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings:
'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
"The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
"One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community

>>To open terminal directly: ctrl - alt -T
>>To leave the Python prompt and return to a terminal prompt: ctrl -D or enter exit()
>>To change working directory(folder): cd ....(folder name)
>>To know about present directory: pwd
>>To see all list in the present directory: ls

Summary_chapter_01: 
 "In this chapter I learned a bit about Python in general, and I installed
Python to my system. I will look to install a text editor to make it easier to write Python code. I learned to run snippets(small part) of Python code in a terminal session, and I ran my first actual program,hello_world.py. I probably learned a bit about troubleshooting as well.
 In the next chapter I’ll learn about the different kinds of data I can work with in my Python programs, and I’ll learn to use variables as well."
