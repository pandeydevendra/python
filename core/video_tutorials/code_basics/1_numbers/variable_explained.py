# mango, lemon, tree are termed as "container, urn or bag" and the same is called as "variable".
#by calling 'print' format it can be made to print the value assigned to the "container/variable" i.e.:>
print(mango) # on running, it will give assigned value.

total=mango+lemon+tree  #A relation will give addition of all int(integer/numerals) type data only
print(total)

# similarly other values can also be made to print ..
#Now:>
        #introduce new variables, likes:.>

item1="mango" #it can be in single'/or double"/or triple ''' invereted comma; but not in "' /and "".
item2="lemon"
item3="tree"
#by introducing new variables one can print the "name" of those items like mango, lemon etc.
print("All things:",item1,item2,item3)
#terms like mango, lemon under 'a',"b" or '''c''' coat are called str(string/words/sentences), it can be "10" i.e.
#by writing int under coat it becomes string eg"20".

#Varialbes: int(5,10,68), float(10.5, 20.33), str("10", 'hello', '''rice''', "it's your pen")
All=item1+item2+item3
print(All) # it will add all strings(words/sentences) to make a complete sentece.
